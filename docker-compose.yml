    # --- ADDED HEALTHCHECK ---
    # This check will run inside the container to see if Postgres is ready.
    # --- THIS IS THE FIRST KEY FIX ---
    # This healthcheck ensures the backend waits until Postgres is truly ready.

    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${DB_USER} -d ${DB_NAME}"]

      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    # --- CLEANED UP ENVIRONMENT ---
    # We pass only the variables the application actually needs.
    # This is much cleaner than using env_file here.
    environment:
      # The connection string is the single source of truth for the DB connection.
      # The hostname is 'db', which is the service name. Docker's internal DNS handles this.
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql+asyncpg://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@db:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}" # Using asyncpg for FastAPI
      # Pass other necessary variables explicitly
      # --- THIS IS THE SECOND KEY FIX ---
      # This tells Docker to wait for the 'db' service to be 'healthy' before starting.
      # --- THIS IS THE THIRD KEY FIX ---
      # We explicitly define the environment variables the backend needs.
      # The DATABASE_URL is now the single source of truth for the connection.
      # It uses the correct driver ('psycopg2') and hostname ('db').
